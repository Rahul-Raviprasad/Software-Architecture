### Interface: Adjective

It should be an adjective mostly, like Readable, Runable it can be something else like Remote but it is preferred to be an adjective.

### Class: Noun

Classes are templates for objects and hence should be nouns. use PascalCase
like Student, Person, Computer, HashMap

### Method: Verb
also make sure the verb you chose tells what the method does. Use camelCase
print, write, getUserData etc

### Variable: Noun
again like name, stockPrice

### Constant:
use capital letters. use underscore to separate words
eg. PI, MAX_VALUE
